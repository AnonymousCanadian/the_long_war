@support_prov_gov
title: Support the Provisional Government.
subtitle: -1 resource
choose-if: b_resources >= 1
on-arrival: b_k_relation += 6*(1-b_dissent); soviet_cooperation += 0.04*(1-b_dissent);

Our propaganda campaign is aimed at supporting the Provisional Government and Soviet cooperation with the Provisional Government. This raises our relations with the Kadets.

@support_m
title: Support the Menshevik party.
subtitle: -1 resource
choose-if: b_resources >= 1
on-arrival: workers_m += 4*(1-b_dissent); soldiers_m += 4*(1-b_dissent); soldiers_m -= 2 if (war_weariness >= 60 and b_war_policy <= 1);

Our propaganda campaign encourages support for the Menshevik party among the workers and soldiers.

@support_rd
title: Support the ideology of revolutionary defensism - defending a defensive war effort as necessary for peace.
subtitle: -1 resource
choose-if: b_resources >= 1
on-arrival: defensist_strength += 6*(1-b_dissent); 

Our newspapers print editorials in support of revolutionary defensism, arguing that a defensive war is necessary for a peace without annexations and indemnities.

@support_id
title: Support the ideology of internationalism - support immediate negotiations for a peace.
subtitle: -1 resource
choose-if: b_resources >= 1
on-arrival: internationalist_strength += 6*(1-b_dissent); internationalist_dissent -= 5*(1-b_dissent); social_patriot_dissent += 5; defensist_dissent += 4; soldiers_m += 3*(1-b_dissent);

Our newspapers print editorials in support of internationalism, arguing that an immediate peace is necessary. This bolsters the Internationalist faction within the party while upsetting the defensists, and raises our standing with the soldiers.

@support_pat
title: Support the war effort from a social-patriot standpoint.
subtitle: -1 resource
choose-if: b_resources >= 1
on-arrival: social_patriot_strength += 6*(1-b_dissent); social_patriot_dissent -= 5*(1-b_dissent); internationalist_dissent += 5; war_weariness -= 3*(1-b_dissent); 

Our newspapers print editorials in support of the war effort, without any of the revolutionary defensist conditions. This bolsters the Social Patriot faction.
