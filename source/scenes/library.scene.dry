= The Provisional Government

With the abdication of the Tsar, power in Russia has been transferred to the Provisional Government, comprised primarily of liberal members of the Duma and led by Prince Georgy Lvov, a reformist noble. The government has already been recognized by the powers of the Entente.

The leaders of the Provisional Government see its role as continuing to persecute the war and maintaining stability until an elected Constituent Assembly is ready to decide Russia's final form of government.

= Petrograd Soviet

The Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies is an elected council comprised of representatives of workers and soldiers throughout the city. Organized in the wake of the general strike and the breakdown of the established order, it harkens back to the Petrograd Soviet of 1905, which functioned as an alternative government in the city during the revolution of that year.

The leaders of the Soviet were mostly Social Democrat and SR intellectuals who organized an Executive Committee, and elected the Menshevik Nikolai Chkheidze as the chairman. They see its role as acting as a watchdog over the Provisional Government, accepting its authority insofar as it does not contradict the directives of the Soviet.

= Timeline of recent Russian history

# What is to be done? Land and Liberty, People's Will
# Emancipation of the serfs
**1861**: Tsar Alexander II decrees the emancipation of the serfs. However, the former serfs are still ridden by debts and poverty, as they had to pay redemption taxes to buy their freedom from the nobles.

#**1863**: The novel *What Is to Be Done?* by Nikolay Chernyshevsky is published, becoming the inspiration for a generation of revolutionaries.

**1860s-70s**: The ideology of *narodism*, or populism, is developed from various strands of non-Marxist socialist and anarchist thought. This ideology sees the Russian peasants as the protagonists of the future revolution, in contrast to Marxism which sees the urban proletariat as the most revolutionary class. The adherents of narodism launch a movement to "go to the people", going to the countryside to spread revolutionary ideology. This movement fails utterly.

**1879**: People's Will is formed, a secretive group of narodniks aiming to use direct action to overthrow the Tsar. Increasingly the narodniks turn to terrorism and assassinations as a way to spread their revolutionary message.

**1881**: People's Will assassinates Tsar Alexander II. Now, Tsar Alexander III takes power, beginning an era of reaction, a return to "Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality".

#**1891**: A great famine occurs centered in the Volga region. Bad weather is exacerbated by primitive agricultural techniques and government mismanagement, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths.

**1894**: Tsar Alexander III passes away at the age of 49, and Tsar Nicholas II takes the throne at the age of 26. Soon after, he marries Alexandra, who was originally a German princess. She is not liked by the Russian people.

**1897**: The first and only census of the Russian Empire was taken, recording a total of over 125 million inhabitants.

# RSDLP is formed
**1898**: The Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, or RSDLP, is formed, in an attempt to unite all revolutionary Marxist forces in Russia.

**1902**: The Party of Socialist Revolutionaries, or SRs, is formed, uniting various groups of narodniks and agrarian socialists.

**1903**: At the Second Congress of the RSDLP, the division between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks develops, as Vladimir Lenin and Julius Martov clash over various ideological questions.

**1904**: The Russo-Japanese War begins, due to imperialist competition over northeastern China.

**1905**: The Russo-Japanese War ends in major defeats for Russia. Largely due to the privations and defeats of the war, the Revolution of 1905 erupts, starting with the "Bloody Sunday" massacre in St. Petersburg. In response to the Revolution, the tsar issues the October Manifesto, proclaiming some form of constitutional government for Russia and the creation of a Duma, or national legislature. The Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) were formed to run for the Duma.

**1906-1907**: The first and second Dumas were held, based on elections with biased voting rules. Despite the electoral system favoring the wealthy, liberal and socialist parties comprise a majority of the members. The second Duma ends with a coup by Prime Minister Stolypin, with changed voting rules creating a much more conservative Duma. 

**1906**: Stolypin reforms begin, breaking up the traditional agrarian communes and creating private land ownership. The goal is to improve agricultural productivity.

**1900s**: Grigori Rasputin becomes acquainted with the imperial family, and a becomes a strong influence on Empress Alexandra. 

**1914**: The Great War begins with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo, and the Austrian declaration of war on Serbia, leading to a cascading series of war declarations and mobilizations that encompasses all of Europe. The two sides are the Entente of France, Britain, and Russia, and the Central Powers of Germany, Austria, and Turkey (and other countries on both sides). The war goes terribly for Russia, with the defeat in the Battle of Tannenberg.

# Zimmerwald Conference
**1915**: The Zimmerwald Conference is held in Switzerland, bringing together a group of anti-war socialists, including many Russian exiles such as Lenin. They draft a statement against the war. The Russian Empire faces a series of military defeats, culminating in the Great Retreat from all of Poland.

# Brusilov Offensive
**1916**: The Brusilov Offensive is the most successful Russian operation in the war, leading to advances against Austria before stalling out. Despite the success, millions of casualties are taken by Russia. In December, Rasputin is assassinated by a group of nationalist nobles.


@demographics
go-to: menu

**Demographic Groups**

**Peasants**: The largest demographic in Russia, peasants are subsistence farmers who were largely serfs before the emancipation of Tsar Alexander II, and are still deeply tied to the traditional communes. They are a majority of Russia's population, but obviously have very little presence in the city.

**Working Class**: The urban working class - blue-collar workers in factories, workshops, mines, and the like. Most are socialist, supporting either the Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, or SRs. Around 10-20% nationally (much increased due to the war), but a much larger proportion in Petrograd.

**Middle Class**: Urban traders and merchants, bureaucrats, professionals, and the intelligensia. At most 10% of the population, but more common in Petrograd.

**Soldiers**: There are nearly 10 million men [? if womens_battalion: (and some women) ?] who serve in the armies and fleets. Most of them were conscripted from the peasantry.

**Minority nationalities**: At the last census, non-Russian-speakers made up a majority of the population of the empire. The largest minority group are the Ukrainians.

Here is the population by native language as of the 1897 census:

@parties
go-to: menu

**Major Parties:**

**Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Mensheviks)** - The "minority" faction of the RSDLP, the Mensheviks emerged from party splits, reunifications, and further splits in the 1900s. It is in fact the larger party, seeking to organize a mass party among the working class. A social-democratic party based on the teachings of Karl Marx, the party argues that the current revolution is the "bourgeois" revolution. The task of socialists is to achieve a democratic republic and gain political and economic rights for workers. The Mensheviks are deeply divided on their attitudes towards the war and participation in a bourgeois government.

[? if player_party = "Bolshevik": Current relations: [+ bolshevik_menshevik : relationships +] ?]
[? if player_party = "SR": Current relations: [+ sr_menshevik_relation : relationships +] ?]
[? if player_party = "Kadet": Current relations: [+ kadet_menshevik_relation : relationships +] ?]

**Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks)** - The "majority" faction of the RSDLP is in fact the smaller party. Created largely by Vladimir Lenin's arguments in the various RSDLP congresses, the Bolsheviks are seen as more radical. They are a disciplined party of revolutionaries.

[? if player_party = "Menshevik": Current relations: [+ menshevik_bolshevik_relation : relationships +] ?]
[? if player_party = "SR": Current relations: [+ sr_bolshevik_relation : relationships +] ?]
[? if player_party = "Kadet": Current relations: [+ kadet_bolshevik_relation : relationships +] ?]

**Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries (SR)** - The SRs are based in the Russian ideology of *narodism*, or populism, which is an agrarian socialism that sees the traditional Russian village (the *mir*) as the basis of a future socialist society. Their support is strongest in the peasantry, but they have substantial support among workers as well. The SRs are deeply divided between left and right wings based on their attitudes towards the war and participation in government.


[? if player_party = "Menshevik": Current relations: [+ menshevik_sr_relation : relationships +] ?]
[? if player_party = "Bolshevik": Current relations: [+ bolshevik_sr_relation : relationships +] ?]
[? if player_party = "Kadet": Current relations: [+ kadet_sr_relation : relationships +] ?]

**Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets)** - The Kadets were formerly on the left of the political spectrum, but they have moved to the center-right following the revolution. They are a liberal party whose goal is to establish a democratic republic or constitutional monarchy with moderate social reforms, while winning the war. They consider themselves a party representing all of Russian society, but are predominantly based in the middle class.

[? if player_party = "Menshevik": Current relations: [+ menshevik_kadet_relation : relationships +] ?]
[? if player_party = "Bolshevik": Current relations: [+ bolshevik_kadet_relation : relationships +] ?]
[? if player_party = "SR": Current relations: [+ sr_kadet_relation : relationships +] ?]

**Other parties:**

**Popular Socialists** and **Trudoviks** ware rooted in the same *narodist* ideology as the SRs, but argued for a non-revolutionary path to socialism. Alexander Kerensky is the most well-known Trudovik.

**Conservatives** have been largely marginalized since the February Revolution. The **Octobrists** are a conservative-liberal faction that supports constitutional monarchy. Much more radical were the **Union of the Russian People** and the **Black Hundreds**, extremist nationalist and antisemitic groups that were suppressed following the February Revolution.

**Anarchists** are not a formally organized party, but they are prevalent among some of the workers. They are the most radical group and seek to replace the Provisional Government with a federation of free soviets.

There are many **minority nationality parties**, based in the Empire's various nationalities. Some are autonomous branches of broader parties, such as the Ukrainian SRs and Social Democrats. Others are autonomous national movements (often having some national-liberal influences), such as the Kazakh Alash party or the Azeri Musavat party.

**Moderates**

The moderates among the Bolsheviks seek to work with other socialist parties to form a homogeneous socialist government. They are opposed to using force to take power. This grouping is led by Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev.

Strength: [+ moderate_strength : strength_2 +]

**Leninists**

Vladimir Lenin is by far the most influential Bolshevik, although his influence has waned due to his long exile. Lenin is against all cooperation with the Provisional Government or any socialist party that would cooperate with it, and is willing to risk a civil war to end the Great War.

A substantial grouping of Menshevik-aligned Social Democrats actively support the war and the cause of Allied victory, even before the revolution. The venerable Social Democrat Georgy Plekhanov leads a faction called "Unity", a misleadingly named pro-war grouping.

Strength: [+ social_patriot_strength : strength_2 +]

Dissent: [+ social_patriot_dissent : dissent +]


**Revolutionary Defensists**

Ideologically defined by Irakli Tsereteli's "Siberian Zimmerwaldists", the revolutionary defensists only support a defensive war to protect the gains of the revolution, while calling for the international proletariat to rise up and force the powers to accept a general peace without annexations or indemnities. Until the proletariat of Germany rise up, they say that war is still necessary to defend against the Kaiser's counterrevolutionary attack.

Many Social Democrats believe that the cause of the war is primarily French and British imperialism, and that Russian workers and peasants have no business dying for Western or Russian capitalists. They are willing to accept a separate peace, even if it means a loss of territory.
